# Breaks

> Friendly reminder to take a break after a set treshold

## Dependencies

- Build on top of [swayidle](https://github.com/swaywm/swayidle) to help monitor user activity on wayland systems.
- The `notifyUser` func uses [notifyme](https://github.com/mattiasbonte/notifyme) since it's my personal preference, change as you desire.
